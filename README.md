# Bidirectional Error-Aware Fusion Network 
![overall_structure](./figs/overview.png)
### âš¡ Highlights:
Our propose model has the following *merits* that others have not:
- **Memorize the Past**: Our method bidirectionally incorporates both past inpainted frames and forward reference frames to make the current generation become more temporally-consistent.
- **Distinguish the Reality**: Our method exploits mask priors for video inpainting to mark each token when calculating correlation in self-attention, which allows the model to distinguish different tokens according to their sources so as to guide the model to produce more faithful results.
